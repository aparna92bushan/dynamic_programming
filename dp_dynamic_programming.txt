Dynamic programming:
Divide a large problem into smaller sub problems
Solve the sub problem and store the result
using the sub problem we can build the solution of the large problem
pretty much like a recursion , but we will store the intermediary states so that we dont have to recalculate them

Two approaches:-
    1. Top down AKA Memoization
        Breaks down problem into multiple subproblems.
        if the subproblem is already solved, reuse the answer
        otherwise solve the subproblem and store the result

    2. bottom up AKA Tabulation
        builds solution to large problem by solving sub problems
